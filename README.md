## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learnt I need to take more time analysing designs so as to write better HTML. This will make coding easier and faster

### Continued development

- Animations
- Box shadows
- Transitions

### Useful resources

- [Transition on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transitionm) - This gave me a good understanding of transitions to be able to implement it in the project.
